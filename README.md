JCOM1939 Monitor Pro - SAE J1939 Data Monitoring, Recording &amp; Simulation

The JCOM1939 Monitor Software is the perfect tool for monitoring, recording, analyzing, and simulating SAE J1939 data traffic. It works in combination with our SAE J1939 gateways.

This comprehensive and easy-to-use, easy-to-understand Windows software displays not only SAE J1939 data traffic but also allows scanning the network, simulating an ECU (incl. full node address negotiation features), and responding to data request messages.

The communication protocol between the gateway and the host system (PC, Embedded System, Android System, etc.) is well documented, and we provide C/C# source code to read and write CAN data frames.

The JCOM1939 Monitor Software for Windows works in combination with the following SAE J1939 gateways:

SAE J1939 Starter Kit and Network Simulator - 
The starter kit allows you to monitor, simulate, and record any PGN as defined in the SAE J1939-71 Standard, including diagnostic messages according to SAE J1939-73. Many users ask us whether or not we can process specific parameters such as fuel consumption, vehicle speed, vehicle position, etc., and the answer is always yes. However, you need to understand that the starter kit was not designed for specific engine parameters, i.e., you need to know which PGN represents the desired data. Also, the starter kit was not designed to simulate particular diesel engines, but if you enter all PGNs that are being used, you can create and simulate any diesel engine.

SAE J1939 ECU Simulator Board with USB Port  - 
The gateway board is a high-performance, low-latency vehicle network adapter for SAE J1939 applications. It allows any host device with a USB COM port to monitor SAE J1939 data traffic and communicate with the SAE J1939 vehicle network.
The board supports the full SAE J1939 protocol according to J1939/81 Network Management (Address Claiming) and J1939/21 Transport Protocol (TP). It is also supported by an extensive programming interface for Windows and Linux/Ubuntu applications, including complete C/C++/C# source code for short time-to-market developments.
The boardâ€™s strength lies in the fact that the entire SAE J1939 protocol, including all timing requirements, is stored on-chip, thus taking the burden off the primary system. The board uses a USB COM port to communicate with the primary system, i.e., all data transfer is handled through a standard COM port access.
