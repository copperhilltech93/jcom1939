The JCOM.J1939 Gateway Protocol establishes a data exchange between a JCOM.J1939 Series gateway and a host system (e.g., a PC or embedded system such as the Raspberry Pi) via serial communication (UART, USB). The protocol enables the host system to take advantage of the gateway’s capabilities by providing a set of commands from the host and responses from the gateway.

Please note: Accessing the JCOM gateways is operating-system-independent, meaning it does not require a specific library. You can communicate with the gateway per serial port, and we provide programming samples for Windows and Linux (see below).

I will not describe the source code in detail since this would require tremendous effort and time. Every programmer with some basic C# experience will be able to recognize the important parts, and I have tried to keep the program as simple as possible. The code explains the gateway’s most important commands and how to receive feedback and data.
